You are working on my Replit project that uses Node with Express and SQLite (server.js from earlier). I can log in and I see accounts, but clicking any profile does nothing. I also want bigger user cards on the group roster page with name and pictures, and clicking a card should open the full profile. My own profile link also does not open.

Do the following.

Context
1) Database tables already exist: schools, users, school_memberships. The roster endpoint is GET /api/schools/:slug/users. Login returns a user id and the schools the user belongs to.
2) There is no session yet. For now, store the logged in user id from the login response in localStorage so the app can fetch my profile.

Database updates for profiles
1) Add these columns to users if missing: avatar_url TEXT, bio TEXT, class_year INTEGER.
2) Create table user_photos with id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE, url TEXT NOT NULL, created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP.
3) Seed a few avatar_url values and two user_photos per user so I can see pictures in the UI.

Backend API
1) Update GET /api/schools/:slug/users to return id, displayName, email, avatar_url, class_year. Keep it scoped by school_memberships.
2) Add GET /api/users/:id that returns a single user with id, displayName, email, avatar_url, bio, class_year, plus an array of photos from user_photos, plus the list of school slugs the user belongs to.
3) Add GET /api/me that reads a user id from the request in a simple way for now: first check header X-User-Id, else check query param user_id. Return the same shape as GET /api/users/:id. This is only for development until I add real auth.
4) If my app uses client side routing, add Express static file serving and a catch all so deep links work:
   app.use(express.static("public"));
   app.get("*", (req, res) => res.sendFile(require("path").join(__dirname, "public", "index.html")));
   If the project is using React with Vite or a similar setup, configure the same fallback so /profile/:id and /schools/:slug do not 404 on refresh.

Frontend UI
1) If there is already a frontend, detect it and modify it. If there is no frontend, create a minimal React app in a public folder or use EJS templates. Use whatever is already present.
2) Create a GroupRoster page at route /schools/:slug that fetches GET /api/schools/:slug/users and renders a responsive grid of user cards.
   The card should be bigger than before, include user avatar (avatar_url), displayName, and class_year if present. Make the entire card clickable and navigate to /profile/:id.
3) Create a Profile page at route /profile/:id that fetches GET /api/users/:id and renders avatar, name, class_year, bio, photo gallery, and a list of school slugs.
   Also add a My Profile link that routes to /profile/me and resolves to the id saved in localStorage from login. If there is no id in localStorage, show a friendly message to log in.
4) Add simple loading and error states for both pages.

Bug fixes to address the click issue
1) Ensure the anchors or onClick handlers actually call the router navigate function with the correct id.
2) If using client side routing, verify the Express catch all is in place to prevent server 404 for routes like /profile/123.
3) Make sure CORS is enabled if the client and server are on different origins in Replit.
4) Confirm that the roster endpoint returns avatar_url and class_year so the UI has the data it needs.

Tests and manual steps
1) Run migrations for SQLite to add the new columns and the user_photos table. Show the exact SQL used and the console output.
2) Seed one school with slug princeton if not present, create two users in that school, set an avatar_url and two user_photos per user, and set class_year for both.
3) Login as one of the users and save the returned user id in localStorage. Show the code that saves it after a successful login.
4) Visit /schools/princeton and confirm the larger cards render with avatar, name, and class year. Clicking a card goes to /profile/:id and loads the profile with gallery and bio. Clicking My Profile opens my own profile using the id in localStorage.
5) Provide me with curl examples for:
   GET /api/schools/princeton/users
   GET /api/users/{id}
   GET /api/me?user_id={id}

Deliverables
1) Any updated SQL migration files
2) Updated server.js with the new routes and the static catch all if needed
3) Frontend files for the roster page and the profile page, either React or EJS, consistent with the current project
4) A short README section with run instructions and the manual test steps above

Please keep names and file paths consistent with the current project, and explain any changes you make at the top of the PR message or summary.
